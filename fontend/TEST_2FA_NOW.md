# 2FA Login Test - Next Steps

## Debug Logging Added

I've added detailed logging at every step of the 2FA flow. When you test now, you should see:

### Stage 1: Initial Login (email + password)
```
=== Login with TOTP Response ===
{JSON response}
================================
2FA required, not saving tokens
[AuthProvider] requiresTwoFactor: true
[AuthProvider] Returning requiresTwoFactor=true
=== Login Result ===
requiresTwoFactor: true
success: false
====================
Navigating to TOTP verification screen...
```

### Stage 2: TOTP Code Entry
```
User entered TOTP code: 123456
Verifying TOTP...
[AuthProvider] Verifying TOTP code: 123456
=== Login with TOTP Response ===
{JSON response with full token}
================================
Login successful, tokens saved
[AuthProvider] TOTP verification response:
  requiresTwoFactor: false
  token length: 500+
[AuthProvider] TOTP verification successful, user logged in
TOTP verification result: true
Login successful! Navigating to main screen...
```

## What to Test

1. **Hot reload the app** (press 'r' in the terminal where flutter run is active)

2. **Login with admin@be1.com**
   - Enter email and password
   - Press login button
   
3. **You should see**:
   - TOTP verification screen appears
   - Enter 6-digit code from Google Authenticator
   
4. **Share the complete console output** including:
   - All print statements
   - Any error messages

## Expected Behavior

✅ **If working correctly:**
- Console shows "Navigating to TOTP verification screen..."
- TOTP screen appears
- You enter code
- Console shows "Login successful! Navigating to main screen..."
- Main app screen opens

❌ **If still broken:**
- Share which stage fails
- Share the exact error message
- Share all console output

## Common Issues to Check

### Issue 1: TOTP screen doesn't appear
- Console will show the login result
- If `requiresTwoFactor: true` but no navigation message, there's a UI issue

### Issue 2: TOTP code rejected
- Console will show: "[AuthProvider] TOTP code rejected"
- Could be:
  - Wrong code from authenticator
  - Time sync issue
  - Secret key mismatch in database

### Issue 3: API error on TOTP verification
- Console will show: "Login with TOTP error: ..."
- Likely backend validation issue

## Quick Fixes

### If time sync issue:
```powershell
# Check system time on both devices
# Server time:
Get-Date -Format "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss"

# Phone time: Settings > Date & Time > Automatic
```

### If secret key issue:
```sql
-- Check in database:
SELECT Email, TotpSecretKey, IsTotpEnabled 
FROM AspNetUsers 
WHERE Email = 'admin@be1.com'

-- TotpSecretKey should NOT be NULL
-- IsTotpEnabled should be 1
```

## Ready to Test!

Hot reload now and login with admin@be1.com. Share the full console output and I'll identify the exact issue.
